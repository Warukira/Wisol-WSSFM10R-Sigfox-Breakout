## Wisol WSSFM10R Sigfox Breakout Board

This breakout board connects your Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other devices to the Sigfox IoT network for low-power, long-range communications. The board uses the Wisol WSSFM10Rx module to connect to the Sigfox network. The interface between the device and the breakout board is based on UART Serial I/O at 9600 bps with 4 pins (3.3V, GND, TX, RX). A U.FL antenna and a Sigfox network subscription are required.

- Autodesk EAGLE board and schematic for Wisol WSSFM10R2/4 Sigfox Breakout board (Sigfox Zones RCZ2 and RCZ4) are in `Wisol-Breakout.brd` and `Wisol-Breakout.sch`

- The PCB design uses 4 layers. If you're using the Free Edition of Autodesk EAGLE, you will only see the top and bottom layers.
  Subscribe to the Standard Edition of Autodesk EAGLE to see all 4 layers.

- Formatted for Seeed Fusion PCB Assembly service, so that you may submit the files from this repository and order the breakout board fully assembled with the onboard components, including the Wisol Sigfox module: <br>

- PCB layout was validated in Autodesk EAGLE with the Seeed Fusion Design Rules `SeeedStudio_4layer_DRU_no_angle_20140221.dru`

- PCB design was exported from Autodesk EAGLE to Seeed Fusion in Gerber RS-274x and Excellon (drill) formats using the CAM Processor `Seeed_Gerber_Generater_4-layer_1-2-15-16.cam`

## Changes for Sigfox Zones RCZ1 and RCZ3

The design here was created for Wisol WSSFM10R2 and R4 (Sigfox Zones RCZ2 and RCZ4). For Wisol WSSFM10R1 and R3 (Sigfox Zones RCZ1 and RCZ3) the footprint is smaller and the module needs to be moved down by 5mm.  All other pins and components are unchanged.
