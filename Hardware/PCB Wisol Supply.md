Dear Luppy,

Your order 180703171002-A859414 has been finished except the part(WSSFM10R4AT) unsoldering. 
The part is short in supply, and we are incapable to get it.

Is there any subsidiary for it?

Or could you buy and ship it to us? Seeed will pay for you.

Or could we leave the location out?

So sorry for the inconvenience!

Thank you!

Best regards!
